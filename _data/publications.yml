  abstract: "The rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, is crucial for effective containment and treatment,
             particularly in resource-constrained environments. This study presents an AI-driven diagnostic tool developed for deployment 
             on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, leveraging the pre-trained MobileNetV2 architecture for binary classification. The model was 
             trained on the open-source Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset, achieving a 93.07% F1-Score, which reflects a well-balanced 
             performance in precision and recall. To optimize the model, the TensorRT framework was used to accelerate inference for FP32 
             and to perform post-training quantization for FP16 and INT8 formats. TensorRT's mixed-precision capabilities enabled these 
             optimizations, which reduced the model size, increased inference speed, and lowered power consumption by approximately a 
             factor of two, all while maintaining the original accuracy. Power consumption analysis confirmed that the optimized models 
             used significantly less energy during inference, reinforcing their suitability for deployment in resource-constrained 
             environments. The system was deployed with a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) hotspot and a web-based interface, enabling users to 
             upload and analyze images directly through connected devices such as mobile phones. This setup ensures simple access and 
             seamless connectivity, making the tool practical for real-world applications. These advancements position the diagnostic 
             tool as an efficient, scalable, and energy-conscious solution to address diagnosis challenges in underserved regions, paving 
             the way for broader adoption in low-resource healthcare settings."
