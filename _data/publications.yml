  abstract: "Rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases, such as monkeypox, is essential for effective containment and treatment, particularly
             in resource-constrained settings. This study presents an AI-driven diagnos- tic tool optimized for deployment on the 
             NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. Several pre-trained architectures were evaluated, with MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 achieving the 
             best F1-scores of 91.87% and 86.70%, respec- tively, on the Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset (MSLD and MSLD v2.0). TensorRT was 
             used for model optimization, leveraging FP32, FP16, and INT8 precision formats to accelerate inference while reducing model 
             size and power consumption. Results show up to 2.52x speedup and improved energy efficiency with minimal accuracy loss. 
             The system was deployed with a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) hotspot and a web-based interface, en- abling users to upload and 
             analyze images directly through connected devices such as mobile phones. These advancements position the tool as a scalable, 
             efficient, and low-power diagnostic solution for deployment in underserved healthcare settings."

  abstract: "Skin cancer is one of the most common and preventable cancers, yet early detection remains challenging, especially in 
             resource- limited settings with scarce specialized healthcare. This study develops an AI-driven diagnostic tool optimized 
             for embedded systems to ad- dress this gap. Using transfer learning with MobileNetV2, the model was trained for multi-class 
             classification of skin lesions and optimized with TensorRT for deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. Evalua- tions 
             focused on model size, inference speed, throughput, and power con- sumption, balancing performance with efficiency. 
             The optimized model maintained an F1-score of 65% while significantly reducing model size and energy consumption. 
             Despite not achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, this research prioritizes real-world feasibility, demonstrating A's 
             poten- tial for accessible diagnostics in low-resource environments. The meth- ods presented extend beyond skin cancer 
             detection, with applications in other medical and autonomous systems, highlighting the broader impact of AI-driven solutions 
             on global healthcare accessibility."

  abstract: "Anemia is a widespread global health issue, particularly among young children in low-resource settings. Traditional methods 
             for anemia detection often require expensive equipment and expert knowledge, cre- ating barriers to early and accurate 
             diagnosis. To address these chal- lenges, we explore the use of deep learning models for detecting anemia through 
             conjunctival pallor, focusing on the CP-AnemiC dataset, which includes 710 images from children aged 6-59 months. 
             The dataset is annotated with hemoglobin levels, gender, age, and other demographic data, enabling the development of 
             machine learning models for accurate anemia detection. We use the MobileNet architecture as a backbone, known for its 
             efficiency in mobile and embedded vision applications, and fine-tune our model end-to-end using data augmentation techniques 
             and a cross-validation strategy. Our model implementation achieved an accu- racy of 0.9313, a precision of 0.9374, and an 
             F1 score of 0.9773, demon- strating strong performance on the dataset. To optimize the model for deployment on edge devices,
             we performed post-training quantization, evaluating the impact of different bit-widths (FP32, FP16, INT8, and INT4) on model 
             performance. Preliminary results suggest that while FP16 quantization maintains high accuracy (0.9250), precision (0.9370) 
             and F1 score (0.9377), more aggressive quantization (INT8 and INT4) leads to significant performance degradation. Overall, 
             our study supports further exploration of quantization schemes and hardware optimizations to assess trade-offs between model 
             size, inference time, and diagnostic accuracy in mobile healthcare applications."
