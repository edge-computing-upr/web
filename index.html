<!-- Welcome Message -->

  Welcome to the Edge Computing Group based in the <a href="https://www.uprm.edu/cid/" target="_blank">Research & Development Center</a>

<!-- About the Lab -->
<div style="margin: 30px auto; max-width: 800px; text-align: justify; font-size: smaller;">
  <p>
    The Edge Computing Group (ECG) is directed by Dr. Wilfredo Lugo Beauchamp, Assistant Professor in the
    Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM). The ECG
    focuses on developing tools to decrease resource requirements current computing methods consume before,
    during, and after deployment, including power, processing, and memory demands. We specialize in applying
    complex algorithms to run efficiently on resource-constrained environments, namely embedded systems such
    as IoT devices and wearable sensors. By optimizing computation at the edge, we aim to minimize data 
    transfer, enhance privacy, and unlock new possibilities for real-time applications in areas like
    agriculture, healthcare, and environmental conservation.</p>

    <h3>Model Compression Engine for Wearable Devices on Skin Cancer</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: smaller;">
      When it comes to saving a person's life, early detection of illnesses can make the difference between
      life and death. Machine learning models can be of great help in this case, but their complexity scales
      with their effectiveness, limiting the types of devices that can run said models. Our objective with
      this project is to develop a compact model that is capable of running in edge devices while maintaining
      an acceptable level of accuracy when it comes to detecting skin cancer. We seek to achieve this via a
      technique called transfer learning, where we take a reliable model that has shown to be effective in
      other areas, MobileNet V2 in our case, and we modify and train its outer layers so that it is capable
      of classifying pictures of a patient afflicted with skin cancer.

    <h3>Addressing Memory Consumption in Edge Devices through Data Quantization</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: smaller;">
      In Puerto Rico, frequent natural disasters disrupt healthcare systems, making it essential to develop
      diagnostic tools that work without relying on central networks. Our project focuses on optimizing deep
      learning models by reducing their memory and computational demands, allowing them to run efficiently on
      portable devices. We aim to do this through quantization, essentially converting 32-bit data to 8-bit,
      significantly cutting memory usage. This approach will be applied to a biomedical case of anemia
      detection through conjunctiva pallor analysis. By using lightweight models, we hope to create effective,
      low-power diagnostic tools that can function in areas with limited infrastructure, improving healthcare
      access during emergencies.
