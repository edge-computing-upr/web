  Welcome to the Edge Computing Group at the <a href="https://www.uprm.edu/portada/">University of Puerto Rico Mayag√ºez</a>!
</p>

<p>
Our lab focuses on advancing Edge Computing by developing innovative techniques to reduce computational requirements, including power, processing, and memory demands. We specialize in enabling complex algorithms to run efficiently on resource-constrained hardware, such as IoT devices and sensors, where data is generated. By optimizing computation at the edge, we aim to minimize data transfer, enhance privacy, and unlock new possibilities for real-time applications in areas like agriculture, healthcare, and environmental monitoring.
