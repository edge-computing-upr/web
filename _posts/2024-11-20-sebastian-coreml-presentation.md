Sebastian presented an insightful overview of Apple's CoreML framework and its applications in edge computing. The presentation covered the fundamentals of CoreML, including model conversion, optimization techniques, and deployment strategies for iOS devices.

The talk highlighted how CoreML enables on-device machine learning inference, reducing latency and improving privacy by keeping data processing local. Sebastian demonstrated practical examples of deploying custom models for real-time image recognition and natural language processing applications.

This presentation opened up new possibilities for our lab's research in mobile edge computing and privacy-preserving AI applications.
