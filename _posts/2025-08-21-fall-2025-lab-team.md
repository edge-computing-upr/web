Excited to welcome a new semester with both familiar faces and new members joining the team. Together, we’re diving into projects that span from low-rank approximations of convolutional layers to automating knowledge distillation and quantization across entire model libraries, and even exploring applications like portable orchid identification and mini load distribution on NVIDIA Jetson devices.

Proud of the passion and creativity this group brings every semester—looking forward to seeing how far we can push the boundaries of Edge Computing this time around!
