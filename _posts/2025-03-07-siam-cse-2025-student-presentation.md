March 3–7, 2025 — We’re proud to share that one of our undergraduate researchers presented at the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Conference on Computational Science & Engineering 2025 in Fort Worth, TX.

As part of the Building Engagement Program, our student received support to present the work "Evaluating Performance of Neural Network Quantization for Conjunctival Pallor Anemia Detection." This research advances our lab’s mission of bringing effective AI to low-resource settings by making deep learning models lighter and more efficient while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

We extend our sincere thanks to the Sustainable Horizons Institute for sponsoring this participation, and to mentor and Guided Affinity Group Lead Malena Español and the Inverse Problems & Applications Group for their tremendous guidance and support.

To everyone who engaged with our student at the conference—thank you for your thoughtful discussions, insightful feedback, and new collaborations. We look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of Edge AI for healthcare.
