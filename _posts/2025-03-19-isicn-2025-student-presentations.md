March 17â€“19, 2025 â€” Last week, we had a proud moment for the Edge Computing Group at University of Puerto Ricoâ€“MayagÃ¼ez! ðŸŽ‰

At ISICN 2025, our undergraduate researchers showcased their work on Machine Learning Model Compression across multiple healthcare applications.

- Luis Fernandez presented on Model Compression for Wearable Devices in Skin Cancer Screening.
- JACOB M DELGADO-LOPEZ discussed Computer Vision for Real-Time Monkeypox Detection on Embedded Systems.
- SebastiÃ¡n A. Cruz-Romero analyzed Post-Training Quantization for CNN-Based Conjunctival Pallor Anemia Detection.

This was a fantastic experience for our team! A huge congratulations to our students for their hard work and dedication. The future of Edge AI is bright!
