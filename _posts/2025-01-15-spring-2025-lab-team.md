We're excited to announce our Spring 2025 lab team! This semester brings together passionate students from various engineering disciplines to work on cutting-edge computing solutions. Our new members will be contributing to projects in biomedical engineering, agricultural sciences, and transportation management.

The team includes both undergraduate and graduate students who will be working on innovative edge computing applications. Each member brings unique perspectives and skills that will help us push the boundaries of what's possible with edge computing technology.

Stay tuned for updates on their research projects and achievements throughout the semester!
