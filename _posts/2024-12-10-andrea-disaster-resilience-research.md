Andrea's groundbreaking research focuses on developing edge computing solutions for disaster resilience and emergency response systems. Her work addresses critical challenges in communication and data processing during natural disasters when traditional infrastructure may be compromised.

The research explores how edge computing can provide reliable, low-latency communication and data processing capabilities in disaster scenarios. This includes developing robust algorithms for resource allocation, real-time data analysis, and coordination between emergency response teams.

This work has significant implications for improving disaster response effectiveness and could save lives in emergency situations.
