March 2025 ‚Äî üå± Bringing Technology to Agriculture: Supporting Sigatoka Disease Research üå±

This week, our students supported ongoing research led by the Agricultural Extension Service and Professor Wanda Almod√≥var on early detection of Sigatoka disease in plantains. üçåüî¨

Their work focuses on understanding and mitigating the disease‚Äôs impact on Puerto Rican farmers. Our role is to explore how spectral imaging and edge computing can assist in developing a low-power portable device to detect the disease before it becomes visible to the human eye. This could provide farmers with an early warning system, helping them take action before their crops are affected.

Team:
- Led by Phytopathology Professor Wanda Almod√≥var
- Agricultural Extension Service: Vilmaris Bracero, Bryan Hernandez
- Microbiology Student: Wesley Mercado
- Edge Computing and Model Compression: CSE Students Luis Fernandez and Eithan M. Capella Mu√±iz

A special thank you to Nelson Tubens, the owner of the farm, for allowing us to conduct research on-site. This collaboration is a perfect example of how technology and agriculture can work together to solve real-world challenges.

We‚Äôre excited to continue supporting this and other efforts and look forward to seeing how technology can enhance agricultural resilience in Puerto Rico.

Collaboration across fields, impact across communities...
