Andrea showcased her poster titled: "Energy-Efficient Autonomous Traffic Management for Disaster Resilience in Puerto Rico."

Her work focuses on compressing machine learning models to run on low-power controllers, ensuring that traffic lights can remain operational even during blackouts or hurricanes. By enabling car detection models to function on battery-powered systems, her research addresses a critical need for disaster resilience in Puerto Rico.

## Fall 2024 Semester

To wrap it up, Sebastian demonstrated a CoreML classification model using MobileNet in his iPhone 12. We laughed when the output stated I was wearing a military uniform (31.3%) or a bulletproof vest (7.5%). In reality, I was just in a green long-sleeve!
